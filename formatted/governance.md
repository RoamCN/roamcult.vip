## [Ethereum Whitepaper](Ethereum Whitepaper.md)
- In general, there are three types of applications on top of Ethereum. The first category is financial applications, providing users with more powerful ways of managing and entering into contracts using their money. This includes sub-currencies, financial [derivatives](derivatives.md), [hedging](hedging.md) contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts. The second category is semi-financial applications, where money is involved but there is also a heavy non-monetary side to what is being done; a perfect example is self-enforcing [bounties](bounties.md) for solutions to computational problems. Finally, there are applications such as online voting and decentralized [governance](governance.md)
