- __Hi,__
- At first glance, Roam doesn't seem all that capable of being a good task manager, but here is where the building blocks of Roam combine to allow you to create the workflows that match your specific needs.
- The base block is the TODO. You can add, or turn, a block into a TODO at any time by editing anywhere in the block and using the /TODO slash command. It'll add the magic syntax to the beginning of the block and give you a checkbox to be able to check off when it's done. Similarly, you can create one using the keyboard shortcut Command-Enter. If you keep pressing the shortcut, it will toggle the block between TODO and DONE and removing the TODO checkbox.
- Well, great, you may be saying. You can create TODOs all over the place, how are you ever supposed to find them again?
- Now, if you were paying close attention to the syntax that Roam puts in for a TODO, you'll see that the word TODO is wrapped in page reference brackets. And so is DONE for the completed ones. You can search for these pages, or maybe even add them to your page shortcuts, and you'll see all your TODOs in the linked references.
- If you have added tags to your TODO blocks, then you can also use the linked references filter to narrow down the list.

## Getting Things Done
- Your daily notes page is a great place to add a list of tasks you need to get done. Creating a TODO section keeps them all together, and you can add new ones to the end of your list as they crop up.

### Kanban boards
- What's even better is Roam can create Kanban boards so you can visually track your task progress. A Kanban board is a lightweight visual way of representing work at various stages of a process. The columns represent the stages of the process - for example, a simple system for TODOs could be To-Do, Doing, Done. The items in the column are the work items at that stage of the process.
- Set up your TODO list in Roam to look something like this.

- The first level below your grouping block (in my example, that's Daily TODOs) are the column headings. You can make them page references, which is convenient if you want to jump off somewhere else. Then list all your TODOs under the first heading.
- Then, on the grouping block (Daily TODOs), use the slash command to add /Kanban Board to it. Roam will insert a graphical representation of your lists. You can interact fully with it, dragging your TODOs from column to column.

- Note that Roam won't automatically complete any TODOs. You do have to check them off manually.
- Obviously, kanban boards are not just for TODOs. You can use them for tracking anything through stages of a process. I'll be covering some specific workflows in the future, but since a common reason to use Roam is for writing, a content pipeline for article ideas.

### Pomodoro Timers
- While we're on the topic of getting things done, a recent addition to Roam is a Pomodoro timer. The Pomodoro technique is the simple idea of working for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. You can add a timer to any block in Roam with the /Pomodoro Timer slash command. That'll add the syntax for a button you can click to start the timer. When the timer reaches zero, you'll hear a bing and the 5-minute break starts. When that's completed, you'll get a green checkbox to indicate it's done.

### Future dates
- Most of the time, we actually have things we need to get done on a specific future date. In Roam, that's as simple as using the date picker slash command to choose the future date to add to your TODO block. When the day rolls around, you'll see the TODO surfaced in the linked references on the daily notes page.

## More Advanced Workflows
- Hopefully, this has given you a flavour of how you can combine the simple building blocks you've learnt so far. If you're just starting out with Roam, there's a temptation to want to figure everything out into the "perfect" system. Don't worry about this yet, let it grow organically as you learn and understand more about how Roam works and how you can combine that with the way you work best. You'll see what works and then you can build on it. Roam makes it easy to find and change things later.
- In tomorrow's lesson we'll be covering Roam's **Query** syntax, it's one of the keys to creating more complex workflows for managing your tasks in Roam. It can be used to find overdue TODOs and combined with tags to build a complete GTD-like system if you want to.
- As always, if you have any feedback or a burning question you'd like answered, feel free to reply to this email. I'll do my best to respond and incorporate it into revised versions and future lessons.
- Until tomorrow,
- Andy
