- [Satoshi Nakamoto](<Satoshi Nakamoto.md>)'s development of [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) in [2009](<2009.md>) has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or [intrinsic value](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/8640/an-exploration-of-intrinsic-value-what-it-is-why-bitcoin-doesnt-have-it-and-why-bitcoin-does-have-it/) and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another - arguably more important - part of the [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) experiment is the underlying [blockchain](<blockchain.md>)

However, another - arguably more important - part of the [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) experiment is the underlying [blockchain](<blockchain.md>) technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>). Commonly cited alternative applications of [blockchain](<blockchain.md>)

- If we had access to a trustworthy [centralized](<centralized.md>) service, this system would be trivial to implement; it could simply be coded exactly as described, using a centralized server's hard drive to keep track of the state. However, with [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) we are trying to build a decentralized currency system, so we will need to combine the state transition system with a [consensus](<consensus.md>) system in order to ensure that everyone agrees on the order of transactions. Bitcoin's decentralized consensus process requires nodes in the network to continuously attempt to produce packages of transactions called "[blocks](<blocks.md>)". The network is intended to produce roughly one block every ten minutes, with each block containing a timestamp, a nonce, a reference to (ie. hash of) the previous block and a list of all of the transactions that have taken place since the previous block. Over time, this creates a persistent, ever-growing, "[blockchain](<blockchain.md>)"

- The idea of taking the underlying [blockchain](<blockchain.md>)

- The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a [blockchain](<blockchain.md>)
