## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- Note that in the future, it is likely that Ethereum will switch to a proof-of-stake model for security, reducing the issuance requirement to somewhere between zero and 0.05X per year. In the event that the Ethereum organization loses funding or for any other reason disappears, we leave open a "social contract": anyone has the right to create a future candidate version of Ethereum, with the only condition being that the quantity of ether must be at most equal to `60102216 * (1.198 + 0.26 * n)` where `n` is the number of years after the [genesis block](<genesis block.md>).
