## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- The "state" in [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) is the collection of all coins (technically, "unspent transaction outputs" or [UTXO](<UTXO.md>)) that have been mined and not yet spent, with each [UTXO](<UTXO.md>) having a denomination and an owner (defined by a 20-byte address which is essentially a cryptographic [public key](<public key.md>)[fn. 1](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/[notes](<notes.md>))). A [transaction](<transaction.md>) contains one or more inputs, with each input containing a reference to an existing [UTXO](<UTXO.md>) and a cryptographic [signature](<signature.md>)

- A [signature](<signature.md>)
