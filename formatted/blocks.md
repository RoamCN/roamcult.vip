## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- If we had access to a trustworthy [centralized](<centralized.md>) service, this system would be trivial to implement; it could simply be coded exactly as described, using a centralized server's hard drive to keep track of the state. However, with [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) we are trying to build a decentralized currency system, so we will need to combine the state transition system with a [consensus](<consensus.md>) system in order to ensure that everyone agrees on the order of transactions. Bitcoin's decentralized consensus process requires nodes in the network to continuously attempt to produce packages of transactions called "[blocks](<blocks.md>)"
