## [Ethereum Whitepaper](Ethereum Whitepaper.md)
- The "state" in [Bitcoin](Bitcoin.md) is the collection of all coins (technically, "unspent transaction outputs" or [UTXO](UTXO.md)) that have been mined and not yet spent, with each [UTXO](UTXO.md) having a denomination and an owner (defined by a 20-byte address which is essentially a cryptographic [public key](public key.md)[fn. 1](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/[notes](notes.md))). A [transaction](transaction.md) contains one or more inputs, with each input containing a reference to an existing [UTXO](UTXO.md) and a cryptographic [signature](signature.md) produced by the [private key](private key.md)
