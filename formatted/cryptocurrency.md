- The concept of decentralized digital currency, as well as alternative applications like property registries, has been around for decades. The anonymous e-cash protocols of the 1980s and the 1990s, mostly reliant on a cryptographic primitive known as [Chaumian blinding](Chaumian blinding.md), provided a currency with a high degree of [privacy](privacy.md), but the protocols largely failed to gain traction because of their reliance on a centralized intermediary. In 1998, [Wei Dai](Wei Dai.md)'s [b-money](b-money.md) became the first proposal to introduce the idea of creating money through solving computational puzzles as well as [decentralized](decentralized.md) [consensus](consensus.md), but the proposal was scant on details as to how decentralized consensus could actually be implemented. In [2005](2005.md), [Hal Finney](Hal Finney.md) introduced a concept of [reusable proofs of work](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/), a system which uses ideas from b-money together with [Adam Back](Adam Back.md)'s computationally difficult [Hashcash](Hashcash.md) puzzles to create a concept for a [cryptocurrency](cryptocurrency.md),

- From a technical standpoint, the [ledger](ledger.md) of a [cryptocurrency](cryptocurrency.md)
