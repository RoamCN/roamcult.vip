## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- [Satoshi Nakamoto](<Satoshi Nakamoto.md>)'s development of [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) in [2009](<2009.md>) has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or [intrinsic value](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/8640/an-exploration-of-intrinsic-value-what-it-is-why-bitcoin-doesnt-have-it-and-why-bitcoin-does-have-it/) and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another - arguably more important - part of the [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) experiment is the underlying [blockchain](<blockchain.md>) technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>). Commonly cited alternative applications of [blockchain](<blockchain.md>) technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ([colored coins](https://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit)), the ownership of an underlying physical device ([smart property](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property)), non-fungible assets such as domain names ([Namecoin](<Namecoin.md>)), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules ([smart contracts](<smart contracts.md>))

- The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a [blockchain](<blockchain.md>) with a built-in [Turing-complete](<Turing-complete.md>) programming language, allowing anyone to write [smart contracts](<smart contracts.md>)
