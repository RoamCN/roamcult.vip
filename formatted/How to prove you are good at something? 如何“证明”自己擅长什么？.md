- Building __a Reputation system__ via __PoC(proving of connections)__
    - Are you tired at proving again and again you are good at something ? Every time you are changing jobs,you have to do a __introduction 101__ to show all the work you have done to the 1st-time meet HR/manager or whoever on the hunt but has no idea about you. 
    - And if the proving process doesnt work so well, it frustrates you and leads you to challenge yourself "am i really good at it" and sometimes over-reflecting(spend too much time doing reflection) on "what am i good at?"
    - it is no one's fault,it's just what it is.
    - Believe me we all have unique talent, it just because the proving and matching process.
    - Tbh i just tired and bored with this proving process, so i m always thinking, how to make the process speak itself? like could we build a (reputational) system to dimensionally show my efforts,my work and my connections. 
    
### The problem solvers
        - Linkedin is such typical who is trying to solve this problem by building a social profile system for occupational scenarios(professional). 
        - But now, let alone the garbage ads, it does badly in recommendations and matching. Just don't need to give examples...
        - Previously what I like about LinkedIn is its mutual complementary function(skillsets tagging and complements, recommendation letters, etc), though i do find some people who are matchable it is far from efficient.  
        - Think about those social tags on linkedin. For instance,
            - i m proving i m good at python by tagging `python`skill 
            - i m proving i m good at finance by mentioning i passed CFA Level 123
            - i m proving i m good at design by writing "i have attended Parsons university"
            - and sure , you also write your website,or whatever there in OTHERS TO BE MENTIONED
        - but you see, this is like a piece of paper of your profile. YOU are summarized by a piece of paper. Sad
    
### Why we are not a piece of paper ?
        - So what i m trying to say is ,the proving process is soooo troublesome is because We are always been summarized as a piece of paper. But we are not (a piece of paper) of course,we are unique character and deserve to be presented in a more dimensional way.
    
### So what do we need then
        - Leave Linkedin alone for a second,now think about **"what do we need to build a reputational system to prove what we are good at"**
        - if there is a place...
            - 1) can show a path/ graph of what you have done /been develop (seems like roam)
            - 2) can present others’ compliments words that you are good at it (seems like linkedin function)
            - 3) can show others’ work based on your work (seems like github repo)
    
### Simplify a bit-choose the top 2 features
        - Ok let us not make it complicated 1st, what really matters for the proving process?
        - 1st, to dimensionally show efforts
        - 2nd, to dimensionally show the connections related to that👆,either
            - connected person,or
            - connections
    
### Speak of me
    - For me , previously i got a contract by the university and it's HR said to me 
        - it's good to collaborate with the university and it will add value to your Fat Garage as saying you have been doing projects for univeristies.You can highlight that on your website page.
        - i was like, oh yeah you are right that's the great value add to my ... emm... career?
        - __do i need a career (meaning those always waiting to be hired)? __
        - but to be very honest i didnt do much valuable or say substaintial, i didnt create as much value as i m doing the RoamCN community. NoT AT ALL. 
        - But in that "piece of paper",either website or linkedin,you have to CUT YOUR WORDS by mentioning "the most important thing ". Although you have soooo many stories to prove while you are building RoamCN that you are good at something , you are capable and you can do...
    - So,what can you do? Either drop the "Piece of paper" or...
    
### Build a Reputation system via proving of connections
- 中文 translation 
    - 你是否厌倦了一次又一次地证明自己擅长什么？每次换工作的时候，你都要做一个 "自我介绍101"，向第一次见面的HR/经理或其他对你一无所知的人展示你所做的所有工作。
    - 如果证明过程不那么顺利，就会让你感到沮丧，并导致你挑战自己 "我真的擅长吗"，有时会过度反思（花太多时间做反思）"我擅长什么？"
    - 这不是任何人的错，它就是这样。
    - 相信我，我们有独特的天赋，这只是因为证明和匹配的过程。
    - 坦白讲，我只是厌倦了这个证明过程，所以我总是在想，如何让这个过程自己证明自己，比如我们是否可以建立一个（声誉）系统，以显示我的努力，我的工作和我的关系。
    
### 问题解决者
        - Linkedin就是这样的典型，他们试图通过建立职业场景（专业）的社交档案系统来解决这个问题。
        - 但现在，别说垃圾广告了，在推荐和匹配上都做得很糟糕。就不需要举例了...
        - 之前我喜欢LinkedIn的是它的相互补充功能（技能集标签和补充，推荐信等），虽然我也找到了一些可匹配的人，但它的效率远远不够。 
        - 你知道我在想什么，这些都是linkedin上的社交标签。比如说，你知道我在想什么吗？
            - 我通过在`python`技能那项打个勾✅ 来证明我很擅长python。
            - 我通过加个CFA 123级标签🏷️ 来证明我对金融很在行。
            - 我通过写“我曾在帕森斯大学（美国top设计学校）上学”证明我擅长设计
            - 当然，你也可以把你的网站或其他什么东西写在`其他要提到的`中。
        - 但你看，这就像一张纸的你的个人资料。你是由一张纸总结出来的。😢 
    
### 为什么我们不是一张纸？
        - 所以我想说的是，证明过程之所以如此麻烦，是因为我们总是被概括为一张纸。但我们当然不是（一张纸），我们是独一无二的人物，应该以更立体的方式呈现。
    
### 那么我们需要什么呢？
        - 先别管Linkedin了，现在想想**"我们需要建立一个信誉体系来证明我们的擅长 "**。
        - 如果有一个地方...
            - 1)可以用路径/图谱显示你做过的事/你的多维度的努力(想一想我们可以用Roam做到什么)
            - 2）能把别人的赞美之词呈现出来，说明你很擅长（好像是linkedin的推荐信式子的功能）
            - 3）可以根据你的作品展示别人的作品（好像是github repo）。
    
### 简单点--选择最重要的2个功能
        - 好了，我们先不要把事情搞得很复杂，证明过程中真正重要的是什么？
        - 1、要从不同维度上展现**努力**
        - 2、从维度上展示与该👆 相关的联系，要么是
            - 联系人
            - 连接图
    
### 说说我吧
    - 对于我来说，以前我在大学里得到了一份合同，它的HR对我说：
        - 与大学合作是件好事，它会为你的 "胖车库 "增加价值，因为你一直在为大学做项目，你可以在你的网站页面上强调这一点。
        - 我当时就想，哦，是的，你说的对，这是我......嗯......职业的巨大增值？
        - ____我需要一个...职业（指那些总是等待被雇佣的人）吗？__
        - 但说实话，我在这件事上并没有做太多有价值的事情，或者说是微不足道的，我并没有像我在RoamCN社区做的那样创造很多价值。完全没有。
        - 但在那张 "纸 "上，无论是网站还是Linkedin，你都必须提 "最重要的事情 "以充分利用那张纸。虽然我想说在建立RoamCN的过程中，有太多的故事可以证明我擅长这个那个，我有能力做这个那个......
    - 那么，怎么办呢？要么放弃 "纸片"，要么...
