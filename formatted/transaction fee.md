## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- At the current target of ~2^187, the network must make an average of ~2^69 tries before a valid block is found; in general, the target is recalibrated by the network every 2016 blocks so that on average a new block is produced by some node in the network every ten minutes. In order to compensate miners for this computational work, the [miner](<miner.md>) of every block is entitled to include a transaction giving themselves 12.5 BTC out of nowhere. Additionally, if any transaction has a higher total denomination in its inputs than in its outputs, the difference also goes to the miner as a "[transaction fee](<transaction fee.md>)"
