## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- The contract is very simple; all it is a database inside the Ethereum network that can be added to, but not modified or removed from. Anyone can register a name with some value, and that registration then sticks forever. A more sophisticated name registration contract will also have a "function clause" allowing other contracts to query it, as well as a mechanism for the "owner" (ie. the first registerer) of a name to change the data or transfer ownership. One can even add [reputation](<reputation.md>)

- **8. On-chain decentralized marketplaces**, using the [identity](<identity.md>) and [reputation](<reputation.md>)
