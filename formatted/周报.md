        - 7月2日，Conor连续发了几条推文，从中可以感受到他对于Roam用户的期待是：包容、开放、多元背景。他也很直白的提到，如果你不能和这些人共事，那么Roamresearch不适合你使用。Roam拒绝“封闭”的用户
            - We're still a very small team at Roam, but I'm super proud that we've built an incredibly high trust and genuinely loving environment with people from very diverse backgrounds, cultures, sexual orientations, political and religious beliefs.
            - Some of the character traits we really respect are curiosity, grit, openness, and desire to work closely on a shared mission with people who've had very different life experiences.
            - If you aren't ok working with people whose family members have been deported, with queer people, atheists, feminists, people who care deeply about social justice, AND evangelical Christians, AND red state Republicans, AND heretics of all stripes...

[@Roamresearch](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch)is not for you.
            - We've got very low tolerance for people with very low tolerance. 

If you can tolerate anything except the "outgroup," our stance is that that counts as being very low tolerance.
        - Conor承认愿景(增强个人和集体智慧)的困难性，“I am worried our mission is already too big”
            - And here I am worried our mission is already too big
            - Augmenting individual and collective intelligence is pretty big mission I'd say.
