- The concept of decentralized digital currency, as well as alternative applications like property registries, has been around for decades. The anonymous e-cash protocols of the 1980s and the 1990s, mostly reliant on a cryptographic primitive known as [Chaumian blinding](<Chaumian blinding.md>), provided a currency with a high degree of [privacy](<privacy.md>), but the protocols largely failed to gain traction because of their reliance on a centralized intermediary. In 1998, [Wei Dai](<Wei Dai.md>)'s [b-money](<b-money.md>) became the first proposal to introduce the idea of creating money through solving computational puzzles as well as [decentralized](<decentralized.md>) [consensus](<consensus.md>), but the proposal was scant on details as to how decentralized consensus could actually be implemented. In [2005](<2005.md>),
