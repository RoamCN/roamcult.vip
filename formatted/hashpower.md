## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- The "Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree" ([GHOST](<GHOST.md>)) protocol is an innovation first introduced by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar inÂ [December 2013](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf). The motivation behind GHOST is that blockchains with fast confirmation times currently suffer from reduced security due to a high stale rate - because blocks take a certain time to propagate through the network, if miner A mines a block and then miner B happens to mine another block before miner A's block propagates to B, [miner](<miner.md>) B's block will end up wasted and will not contribute to network security. Furthermore, there is a centralization issue: if miner A is a mining pool with 30% [hashpower](<hashpower.md>)
