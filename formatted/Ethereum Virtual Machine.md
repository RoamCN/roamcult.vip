- **Agility**: details of the Ethereum protocol are not set in stone. Although we will be extremely judicious about making modifications to high-level constructs, for instance with theÂ [sharding roadmap](https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec/1407/), abstracting execution, with only data availability enshrined in consensus. Computational tests later on in the development process may lead us to discover that certain modifications, e.g. to the protocol architecture or to the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](<Ethereum Virtual Machine.md>)
