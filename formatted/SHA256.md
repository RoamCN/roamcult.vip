- The one validity condition present in the above list that is not found in other systems is the requirement for "[proof of work](<proof of work.md>)". The precise condition is that the double-[SHA256](<SHA256.md>)

- The one validity condition present in the above list that is not found in other systems is the requirement for "[proof of work](<proof of work.md>)". The precise condition is that the double-[SHA256](<SHA256.md>) hash of every block, treated as a 256-bit number, must be less than a dynamically adjusted target, which as of the time of this writing is approximately 2187. The purpose of this is to make block creation computationally "hard", thereby preventing sybil attackers from remaking the entire blockchain in their favor. Because [SHA256](<SHA256.md>)
