- At the current target of ~2^187, the network must make an average of ~2^69 tries before a valid block is found; in general, the target is recalibrated by the network every 2016 blocks so that on average a new block is produced by some node in the network every ten minutes. In order to compensate miners for this computational work, the [miner](miner.md)

- The "Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree" ([GHOST](GHOST.md)) protocol is an innovation first introduced by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar in [December 2013](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf). The motivation behind GHOST is that blockchains with fast confirmation times currently suffer from reduced security due to a high stale rate - because blocks take a certain time to propagate through the network, if miner A mines a block and then miner B happens to mine another block before miner A's block propagates to B, [miner](miner.md)
