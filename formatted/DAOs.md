## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- [Satoshi Nakamoto](<Satoshi Nakamoto.md>)'s development of [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) in [2009](<2009.md>) has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or [intrinsic value](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/8640/an-exploration-of-intrinsic-value-what-it-is-why-bitcoin-doesnt-have-it-and-why-bitcoin-does-have-it/) and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another - arguably more important - part of the [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) experiment is the underlying [blockchain](<blockchain.md>) technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>). Commonly cited alternative applications of [blockchain](<blockchain.md>) technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ([colored coins](https://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit)), the ownership of an underlying physical device ([smart property](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property)), non-fungible assets such as domain names ([Namecoin](<Namecoin.md>)), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules ([smart contracts](<smart contracts.md>)) or even blockchain-based [decentralized autonomous organizations](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/7050/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i/) ([DAOs](<DAOs.md>))
