- The mechanism behind [proof of work](proof of work.md) was a breakthrough in the space because it simultaneously solved two problems. First, it provided a simple and moderately effective [consensus](consensus.md) algorithm, allowing nodes in the network to collectively agree on a set of canonical updates to the state of the [Bitcoin](Bitcoin.md) [ledger](ledger.md). Second, it provided a mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus process, solving the political problem of deciding who gets to influence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing [sybil attacks](sybil attacks.md). It does this by substituting a formal barrier to participation, such as the requirement to be registered as a unique entity on a particular list, with an economic barrier - the weight of a single node in the consensus voting process is directly proportional to the computing power that the node brings. Since then, an alternative approach has been proposed called [proof of stake](proof of stake.md),
