## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- The mechanism behind [proof of work](<proof of work.md>) was a breakthrough in the space because it simultaneously solved two problems. First, it provided a simple and moderately effective [consensus](<consensus.md>) algorithm, allowing nodes in the network to collectively agree on a set of canonical updates to the state of the [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) [ledger](<ledger.md>). Second, it provided a mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus process, solving the political problem of deciding who gets to influence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing [sybil attacks](<sybil attacks.md>). It does this by substituting a formal barrier to participation, such as the requirement to be registered as a unique entity on a particular list, with an economic barrier - the weight of a single node in the consensus voting process is directly proportional to the computing power that the node brings. Since then, an alternative approach has been proposed calledÂ [proof of stake](<proof of stake.md>),
