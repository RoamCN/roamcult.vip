## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a [blockchain](<blockchain.md>) with a built-in [Turing-complete](<Turing-complete.md>)

- **Universality**: a fundamental part of Ethereum's design philosophy is that Ethereum does not have "features".[fn. 5](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/[notes](<notes.md>))Â Instead, Ethereum provides an internal [Turing-complete](<Turing-complete.md>)
