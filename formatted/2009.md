- [Satoshi Nakamoto](<Satoshi Nakamoto.md>)'s development of [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) in [2009](<2009.md>)

- The concept of decentralized digital currency, as well as alternative applications like property registries, has been around for decades. The anonymous e-cash protocols of the 1980s and the 1990s, mostly reliant on a cryptographic primitive known as [Chaumian blinding](<Chaumian blinding.md>), provided a currency with a high degree of [privacy](<privacy.md>), but the protocols largely failed to gain traction because of their reliance on a centralized intermediary. In 1998, [Wei Dai](<Wei Dai.md>)'s [b-money](<b-money.md>) became the first proposal to introduce the idea of creating money through solving computational puzzles as well as [decentralized](<decentralized.md>) [consensus](<consensus.md>), but the proposal was scant on details as to how decentralized consensus could actually be implemented. In [2005](<2005.md>), [Hal Finney](<Hal Finney.md>) introduced a concept of [reusable proofs of work](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/), a system which uses ideas from b-money together with [Adam Back](<Adam Back.md>)'s computationally difficult [Hashcash](<Hashcash.md>) puzzles to create a concept for a [cryptocurrency](<cryptocurrency.md>), but once again fell short of the ideal by relying on trusted computing as a backend. In [2009](<2009.md>),

- The idea of taking the underlying [blockchain](<blockchain.md>) idea and applying it to other concepts also has a long history. In [1998](<1998.md>), [Nick Szabo](<Nick Szabo.md>) came out with the concept of [secure property titles with owner authority](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/), a document describing how "new advances in replicated database technology" will allow for a blockchain-based system for storing a registry of who owns what land, creating an elaborate framework including concepts such as homesteading, adverse possession and Georgian land tax. However, there was unfortunately no effective replicated database system available at the time, and so the protocol was never implemented in practice. After [2009](<2009.md>),
