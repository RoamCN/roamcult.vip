## [Ethereum Whitepaper](Ethereum Whitepaper.md)
- The mechanism behind [proof of work](proof of work.md) was a breakthrough in the space because it simultaneously solved two problems. First, it provided a simple and moderately effective [consensus](consensus.md) algorithm, allowing nodes in the network to collectively agree on a set of canonical updates to the state of the [Bitcoin](Bitcoin.md) [ledger](ledger.md). Second, it provided a mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus process, solving the political problem of deciding who gets to influence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing [sybil attacks](sybil attacks.md).
