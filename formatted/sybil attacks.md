## [Ethereum Whitepaper](<Ethereum Whitepaper.md>)
- The mechanism behind [proof of work](<proof of work.md>) was a breakthrough in the space because it simultaneously solved two problems. First, it provided a simple and moderately effective [consensus](<consensus.md>) algorithm, allowing nodes in the network to collectively agree on a set of canonical updates to the state of the [Bitcoin](<Bitcoin.md>) [ledger](<ledger.md>). Second, it provided a mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus process, solving the political problem of deciding who gets to influence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing [sybil attacks](<sybil attacks.md>).
